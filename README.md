About-
This CRUD operation with React is an attempt to mimic the Add to Cart feature from any shopping site. 

How it Works-
1. Add new employee data by clicking on Add New button on top. 
2. Add New screen opens with ID, Name, email and Phone options. These details once entered are saved into db.json file
3. For every entry delete button gets enabled. Once if an entry is deleted from the home screen, it gets deleted from the db.json at the same time as well.

The functionality in this application mimics Add to Cart feature from shopping sites.
